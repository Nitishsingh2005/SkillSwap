# Project Diagnosis and Resolution Guide

This document outlines the step-by-step process followed to diagnose and resolve the server startup issue, and subsequently verify the functionality of the user profile features.

## Part 1: Diagnosing and Fixing the Server Issue

### Step 1: Initial Project Exploration

- **Objective:** Understand the project structure and how to run it.
- **Action:**
  1. Listed all files in the `SkillSwap/Backend` directory to get an overview of the backend codebase.
  2. Examined the `package.json` file to identify project scripts (`start`, `dev`) and dependencies.

### Step 2: Reproducing the Error

- **Objective:** Attempt to start the server to observe any errors.
- **Action:**
  1. Ran the command `cd SkillSwap/Backend; npm install; npm start` to install dependencies and start the server.
  2. The command initially failed due to shell incompatibility with the `&&` operator. It was corrected to use `;`.
  3. The server failed to start, producing a `PathError: Missing parameter name at index 1: *`. This error originated from the `path-to-regexp` package, indicating an invalid route definition in the Express application.

### Step 3: Isolating and Fixing the Bug

- **Objective:** Locate and correct the invalid route.
- **Action:**
  1. Inspected the main server file, `server.js`.
  2. Identified the problematic line: `app.use('*', ...)`. This was intended as a catch-all for 404 (Not Found) routes, but the syntax was incorrect for the routing library.
  3. Replaced the faulty line with the correct Express syntax for a 404 handler: `app.use((req, res) => { ... });`. This middleware correctly catches any request that doesn't match the preceding routes.

### Step 4: Verifying the Fix

- **Objective:** Confirm that the server now starts and runs correctly.
- **Action:**
  1. Restarted the server with `npm start`. The server launched successfully without errors.
  2. Performed a health check by sending a request to the `/api/health` endpoint. The server responded with a success message, confirming it was fully operational.

## Part 2: Verifying User Profile Features

### Step 1: Understanding the Feature Implementation

- **Objective:** Analyze how the portfolio and availability features were implemented across the stack.
- **Action:**
  1. **Database Schema:** Examined the `models/User.js` file to understand how `portfolioLinks` and `availability` data are structured in MongoDB.
  2. **Backend API:** Reviewed `routes/authRoutes.js` to identify the API endpoints responsible for adding, updating, and deleting portfolio and availability data.
  3. **Frontend Component:** Analyzed the `Frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx` file to see how the user interface interacts with the backend API to manage profile data.

### Step 2: Creating an Automated Test Script

- **Objective:** Build a script to test the end-to-end functionality of the profile features.
- **Action:**
  1. Created a new file named `verifyProfileFeatures.js` in the `Backend` directory.
  2. The script was designed to simulate a user's actions:
     - Register a new user.
     - Log in to get an authentication token.
     - Add a new portfolio link.
     - Add a new availability slot.
     - Fetch the user's profile data.
     - Verify that the added portfolio and availability information was correctly saved.

### Step 3: Executing the Test and Confirming Functionality

- **Objective:** Run the test script to ensure the features work as expected.
- **Action:**
  1. Executed the script using `node verifyProfileFeatures.js`.
  2. The script completed successfully, with all steps passing. This confirmed that the portfolio and availability features are fully functional and that data is correctly persisted in the database.

This comprehensive process ensured that the initial server bug was fixed and that critical user profile features were working correctly.

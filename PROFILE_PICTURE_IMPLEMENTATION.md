# Profile Picture Upload Feature - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Frontend Changes (Profile.jsx)

- **Camera Icon Functionality**: The camera icon now opens a file picker when clicked
- **File Upload Handler**: Validates file type (images only) and size (max 5MB)
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner during upload with disabled button
- **Avatar Display**: Properly displays uploaded images with fallback to initials
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for upload failures

### Backend Changes

#### File Upload Middleware (`middleware/upload.js`)

- **Multer Configuration**: Handles multipart/form-data for file uploads
- **File Storage**: Saves avatars to `uploads/avatars/` directory
- **Unique Naming**: Files named as `userId_timestamp.extension`
- **Validation**: Only allows image files, max 5MB size
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for various upload issues

#### API Endpoint (`routes/authRoutes.js`)

- **POST /api/auth/upload-avatar**: New endpoint for avatar uploads
- **Authentication Required**: Protected route requiring valid JWT token
- **File Management**: Automatically deletes old avatar when new one is uploaded
- **Database Update**: Updates user's avatar field in MongoDB
- **Response**: Returns updated user object with new avatar URL

#### Server Configuration (`server.js`)

- **Static File Serving**: Serves uploaded images at `/uploads` endpoint
- **CORS Configuration**: Allows cross-origin requests for file uploads

### Database Schema

- **Avatar Field**: Already exists in User model as String type
- **URL Storage**: Stores relative path (e.g., `/uploads/avatars/filename.jpg`)

5. **Validation**: System ensures file is an image and under 5MB

### For Developers
